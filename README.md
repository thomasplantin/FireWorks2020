# Fireworks Wireless Firing System

This project was built to wirelessly ignite fireworks for New Year's Eve 2020. There are two different modules for this project: a detonator, and a terminal box. In a few words, the way these modules work is that a signal is transmitted from the detonator to the terminal box to turn on one of its outputs. An electronic fuse is connected to the output, so it will ignite the fireworks when current runs through it.
