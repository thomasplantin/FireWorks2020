# Fireworks Wireless Firing System

I built this device to wirelessly ignite fireworks for New Year's Eve 2020. There are two different modules for this project: a detonator, and a terminal box. In a few words, the way these modules work is that a signal is transmitted from the detonator to the terminal box to turn on one of its outputs. Since an electronic fuse is connected to the output, it will ignite the firework that it is linked to when current runs through it.
